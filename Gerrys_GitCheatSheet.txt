Personal Access Token (PAT):

Step 1: Generate a PAT (personal access token) on GitHub

    Log in to your GitHub account on the web.
    Click your profile photo in the upper-right corner, then click Settings.
    In the left sidebar, click Developer settings.
    In the left sidebar, under "Personal access tokens", click Tokens (classic).
    Click Generate new token, then select Generate new token (classic).
    Give your token a descriptive Note
    (e.g., "Git CLI access"), set an Expiration date, and select the necessary scopes (permissions).
    For general repository access, selecting the repo scope is usually sufficient.
    Click Generate token at the bottom of the page.
    Immediately copy the generated token string. You will not be able
    to see it again once you leave the page. Store it securely

Step 2: Update Your Local Credentials
    When you run a Git command that requires authentication (like git push or git pull)
    in your local repository's terminal,
    Git will prompt you for your username and password.

        Username: Enter your GitHub username. - GAH-Man
        Password: Paste the Personal Access Token you generated in
        Step 1 instead of your actual GitHub password.

*****Step 3: Cache Your Credentials (Optional but Recommended)
    DID NOT DO!!!!!!
    To avoid entering the PAT every time,
    configure Git's credential helper to store it securely:

    Windows: Use the Git Credential Manager included with Git for Windows.
    It usually works automatically after the first successful login,
    or you can manage entries in the Windows Credential Manager.

     macOS: git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain.

     Linux: git config --global credential.helper store
     (less secure, saves to a plain text file)
     or use libsecret if you have a desktop environment.

After setting up the credential helper,
the next time you push, enter your username and PAT,
and it should be cached for future use.
  *****Did not due this step, did not want to break Emory GitHub access.

WorkingRepo -> StagingRepo -> RemoteRepo

***************
Git Basics

1.  Create Git Repository
cd into the directory that you want to add to Git.
the repository name will be the name of the directory.
Then run:
git init


2.  Add to Staging Repo (git add)
add Single file:
  git add file_name
add Multiple files:
git add .


3.  Remove from Staging (git rm):
git rm --cached file_name
What it does
Removes the file from the Git index (staging area) only.
Keeps the file on your local working repo.

Remove from Staging (unstage) and from local file system (delete permanently):
git rm -f file_name
What it does
Removes the file from both Git and your working directory
Deletes the file from your filesystem


4. Add to Git Remote Repo (commit)
git commit -m "Your message"
What it does
Commits only what is already staged (in the index)
You must explicitly run git add (or similar) first

git commit -a -m "Your message"
What it does
Automatically stages and commits all tracked files that have been:
Modified
Deleted
Skips the need for git add for those files.
What it does NOT do
Does not include new (untracked) files


5.  View commits:
git log


6. Set Default Editor
Set VS Code as Default Editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

Set Notepad as Default Editor
git config --global core.editor "notepad"


7.  Updating or Uninstalling Git
Update:
Download and run the latest installer, or use your package manager
(e.g., brew upgrade git or sudo apt-get upgrade git).
It's a good idea to keep Git up to date for the latest features and security fixes.
Uninstall:
Use "Add or Remove Programs" on Windows,
or your package manager on Mac/Linux.


8.  Viewing Your Configuration
git config --list
credential.helper=osxkeychain
init.defaultbranch=main
user.email=ghall4@emory.edu
user.name=Gerry Hall
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true
core.ignorecase=true
core.precomposeunicode=true

View a Specific Setting;
git config user.name

Set Default Branch Name:


9. Git checkout
git log

git checkout ae38f29ae62d07b9fd92960e6238f5c016db7c19


10.  Git revert and reset
git log --oneline

git revert commitID
  - reverts to the commit previous to commitID
  - goes back one commit only

git reset --hard commitID
  - resets to the commitID
  - goes back more than one commit only


11.  Git reset.
Types of Git reset.
  soft, mixed, hard
  git reset --soft <commitID>, no changes in the staging repo or working
     Only resets the HEAD,
      leaving both the staging area and the working directory unchanged.
      Use Case:
        Use --soft when you want to adjust the commit history
        (e.g., remove the latest commit)
        but keep all the changes in both the staging area
        and the working directory, allowing you to commit them again.

  git reset --mixed <commitID>, reverts changes in staging repo (the default)
    Resets the HEAD and updates the staging area,
      but leaves the working directory unchanged.
      Use Case:
        Use --mixed when you want to keep your working changes
        but remove them from the staging area.
        This is useful if you realize the changes
        should not be staged yet but you still want to continue working on them.

  git reset --hard <commitID>, removes changes in both staging repo and working directory.
    Resets the HEAD, updates the staging area,
      and resets the working directory to match the specified commit.
    Use Case:
      Use --hard when you want to completely discard any changes
      in the working directory and staging area
      and revert to a specific commit.
      This is often used to undo unwanted changes that are no longer needed.


12. .gitignore
#clear the memory cache
git rm -r --cached .
git add .

(ex.)
# ignore individual files
a.txt
b.txt
c.txt
# ignore all files in Dir
Dir/*

See files that Git will ignore:
git status --ignored


13.  Steps to Ignore Untracked Log Files
Open or create the .gitignore file in your project's root directory
using a text editor or the command line.
touch .gitignore

Add patterns for the log files you want to ignore.
You can use a specific filename,
a wildcard for all files with a .log extension,
or an entire directory.

To ignore a single specific file:
  debug.log

To ignore all files ending with .log in any directory:
  *.log

To ignore a specific directory named logs and all its contents:
  logs/

To ignore all log files,
but make an exception for a specific important log file:
  *.log
  !important.log

Save the .gitignore file.

Stage and commit the .gitignore file to your repository
so the ignore rules are shared with other contributors.
  git add .gitignore
  git commit -m "Add log files to .gitignore"

13-2.  Steps to Ignore Already Tracked Log Files
Open the .gitignore file in your project's root directory
  and add the patterns as described above (e.g., *.log or logs/).

For a single file
  git rm --cached debug.log

For all .log files:
  git rm --cached *.log

For an entire directory (use the -r flag for recursive removal):
  git rm -r --cached logs/

Commit the changes to record the file removals in the repository's history.
  git commit -m "Stop tracking log files"

Push your changes to the remote repository>
  git push


***************
Git Branches
1.  Create
create branch (only):
  git branch NameOfBranch

create and switch to branch
  git checkout -b NameOfBranch

switches back to master
  git checkout master
    NOTE:  'master' may be 'main' instead

list all branches:
  git branch -a

delete branch:
  git branch -d NameOfBranch

2.  Merging
change to branch you want to merge to
(the branch you want to add changes TO):
  git checkout BranchName
add merge from source branch changes
(the branch you want to add changes FROM):
  git merge MergeBranchName


***************
Git Hub

…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# MultiRegion_AGA" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/GAH-Man/MultiRegion_AGA.git
git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/GAH-Man/MultiRegion_AGA.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main



***************
Git and Git Hub

1.  Create remote repository.
      - must be created in Git Hub
      - git init
      - git remote add origin https://UrLFromGit
      - git remote -v
